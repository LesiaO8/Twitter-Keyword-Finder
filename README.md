# Twitter-Keyword-Finder
Search Twitter by keywords and return Tweets

This Dr Who themed hack uses the new Raspberry Pi Zero W with built in Wireless and Bluetooth adapters to stream Tweets and search for a Keyword.  Each relevant Tweet is then written to a Spreadsheet building a up collection.  The Spreadsheet can then be shared and viewed with other users:  Enter any keyword you want and find related Tweets.
